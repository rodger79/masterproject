	abstract = {Summary The increasing convergence of wearable technologies and cloud services in applications, such as health care, could result in new attack vectors for the ‘Cloud of Things’, which could in turn be exploited to exfiltrate sensitive user data. In this paper, we analyze the types of sensitive user data that may be present on a wearable device and develop a method to demonstrate that they can be exfiltrated by an adversary. To undertake this study, we select the Android Wear smartwatch operating system as a case study and, specifically, the Samsung Gear Live smartwatch. We present a technique that allows an adversary to exfiltrate data from smartwatches. Using this technique, we determine that the smartwatch stores a relatively large amount of sensitive user data, including SMS messages, contact information, and biomedical data, and does not effectively protect this user data from physical exfiltration.

	abstract = {Wearable computing devices promise to deliver countless benefits to users. Moreover, they are among the most personal and unique computing devices of all, more so than laptops and tablets and even more so than smartphones. However, this uniqueness also brings with it a risk of security issues not encountered previously in information systems: the potential to not only compromise data, but also to physically harm the wearer. This article considers wearable device security from three perspectives: whether the threat is to the device and/or the individual, the role that the wearable device plays, and how holistic wearable device security strategies can be developed and monitored.},
