\subsection{Background}

Previous research by Sultana\cite{sultana_wearable_nodate} showed that some Android devices had delayed notifications on paired wearable devices. 
Her research was conducted by performing a small manual study measuring the time it took from calling a phone to the time the notification showed up on the wearable device.
That research found that there were significant delays in some of the testing scenarios and they varied by device and operating system.
Some of the potential causes noted in that research were missing patches and updates and limited available storage on devices.
