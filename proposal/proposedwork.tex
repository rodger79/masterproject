\section{Proposed Work}
The proposed work is to test push notificaitons in Android devices. 
\subsection{Initial Phase}
\paragraph{Emulation}
This will involve using Android Studio to emulate and test notifications to determine what can cause delays.
Use debugging tools to determine what can cause delays in notification in andriod devices and wearable devices.
\paragraph{Simulation}
Simulates criteria that may lead to delays, such has low storage, high memory usage, high processor usage to attempt to determine factors that can lead to delays.
Review Android OS patching history to determine what fixes have been put in place related to notifications and wearable devices.
\subsection{Second Phase}
Test findings from initial phase on actual hardware.
