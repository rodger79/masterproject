\section{Completed Work}
\subsection{Initial Testing}
Right away I noticed slow performence on the development laptop I am using. 
The Pixel 3 I was emulating has 4GB of memory and the laptop I was using for testing had 8GB of memory. The emulator had extremely slow performance, and resulted in the laptop being extremely slow as well. 
Further testing is likely going to require hardware with more performance.
\subsection{Capabilities of Android Studio}
\subsection{Emulated Application and Notifications}
To begin the testing the first step was to build an application to push notifications to the device.
The app will (hopefully) measure time for the push notifications.
